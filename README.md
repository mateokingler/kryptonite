# kryptonite
*__Work in progress__*

Simple terminal based scantime crypter. It encrypts a selected payload using 256-bit AES, converts that encrypted data into hex, and then combines the payload with a stubfile. This tool outputs an executable file that is undetectable by anti-viruses at scantime.
